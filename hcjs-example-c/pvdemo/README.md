MOAT C SDK
===

This is a Software Development Kit enabling you to develop MOAT C client application.

## What is MOAT C?
[MOAT C](http://dev.yourinventit.com/references/moat-c-api-document) is a C API to build a client side application interacting with cloud server.
It is a part of [MOAT IoT](http://dev.yourinventit.com/guides/moat-iot), which is a specification set of creating IoT/M2M applications running on InventitÂ® ServiceSync environment.

*****
The library offers you:

* to build and package a MOAT C client application.

## Prerequisites
* gyp
* python 2.6 or 2.7
* GNU Make 3.81 or later
* gcc 4.2 or later

## How to use

### 1. Download a security token for your application package using [IIDN-CLI Tool](https://github.com/inventit/iidn-cli).
    $ sh $CLI/iidn tokengen simple-example

### 2. Deploy your security token into SDK
Copy the downloaded security token into '${SDK_ROOT}/package' as 'token.bin'
    $ cp 1363966226152-token.bin ${SDK_ROOT}/package/token.bin

### 3. Configure and write code
Perform the 'configure' command
    $ cd ${SDK_ROOT}
    $ ./configure
Then, a template source code is deployed in ${SDK_ROOT}/src/${PACKAGE_NAME}.c
Write your application code.

#### configure options
    $ ./configure --help
    Options:
      -h, --help           show this help message and exit
      --debug              Also build debug build
      --dest-cpu=DEST_CPU  CPU architecture to build for. Valid values are: arm,
                           ia32, x64
      --name=PACKAGE_NAME  Package name of your M2M/IoT application
      --token=TOKEN_PATH   Path to the security token file. Default path is
                          './package/token.bin'

#### Cross compile (example)
    $ export CROSS=arm-linux-gnueabi-
    $ export CC=${CROSS}gcc
    $ export CXX=${CROSS}g++
    $ export AR=${CROSS}ar
    $ export RANLIB=${CROSS}ranlib
    $ export strip=${CROSS}strip
    $ cd ${SDK_ROOT}
    $ ./configure --dest-cpu=arm

### 4. Build your application and create a package
    $ make
    $ make package

### 5. Deploy onto Inventit IoT Developer Network(IIDN) Sandbox Server.
You can deploy the created package onto Inventit IoT Developer Network(IIDN) Sandbox Server.
Visit [IIDN site](http://dev.yourinventit.com) 
    $ sh $CLI/iidn bindeploy simple-example.zip

## Where can you deploy?

You can deploy the created package onto Inventit IoT Developer Network(IIDN) Sandbox Server.
